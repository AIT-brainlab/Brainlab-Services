This Repository store knowledge, step, guide, and reference of AIT Brainlab services implementation.

Our current implementation (as of this commit) uses `Jupyterhub` with `dockerspawner` to spawner Docker container. The authentication is done with the `openLDAP`. And, user's work is stored via `NAS`.
