This Repository store knowledge, step, guide, and reference of AIT Brainlab Jupyterhub implementation.

Our current implementation (as of this commit) uses `Jupyterhub` with `dockerspawner` to spawner Docker container. The authentication is done with the `openLDAP`. And, user's work is stored via `NAS`.

This document is separate the knowledge for those who want to replicate the work we have done (admin) and for those who want to use the system (user).
